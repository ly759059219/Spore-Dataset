# Spore Dataset

This repository is associated with the paper:

**"PPBM-YOLO: A Lightweight and Accurate Detection Model for Multi-species Airborne Spores in Wheat Disease Cross-Infection Scenarios"**  
(*Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture*)

## 🔍 Overview

This repository is intended to host the spore dataset associated with the proposed **PPBM-YOLO** model. The dataset comprises airborne spores from three major wheat fungal diseases, along with five types of interfering spores. It is intended solely for academic and non-commercial research purposes.

## 📂 Dataset Availability

We appreciate your interest in our dataset.  
To ensure compliance with journal policies and peer review standards, the full dataset will be made publicly available **after the paper is formally published**.

Planned release includes:
- Raw spore image data
- Annotated labels (YOLO format)
- Data partition files (train/val/test splits)

> ✅ **Expected release: After formal publication of the manuscript.**

### 🔒 Placeholder Archive

A placeholder archive is currently provided as a marker for the future dataset:

- [`SporeDataset_UploadAfterPublication.zip`](./SporeDataset_UploadAfterPublication.zip)

This archive contains a `notice.txt` file that explains the dataset will be released after the manuscript is published.

> 📌 **Note:** No actual data is included in the current archive.
